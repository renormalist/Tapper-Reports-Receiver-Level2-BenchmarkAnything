            # Metric name contemplation:
            # --------------------------
            #
            # There is a decision to make between 1) having
            # $section_metric_name as part of the NAME field or 2) having
            # generic NAMEs with $section_metric_name as an attribute of
            # it.
            #
            # Here we make it part of NAME (option 1).
            #
            # With this it is easier to track a particular test as
            # a metric and store expectations for that test with
            # test independent attributes but consisting of the
            # context in which we measured that metric. That
            # "scope", i.e., the fields that we use to match which
            # expectation to choose, consists then of that many
            # dimensions as we need to describe the context,
            # independent of the number of metrics we have.
            #
            # If we had the metric as additional attribute we had
            # thousands of scope dimensions to maintain because we
            # have thousands of metric names; and we could not
            # clearly separate between the test and its context.
            #
            # From a test philosophical perspective, that decision
            # sets the focus on the *actual result* we care for,
            # instead of some generic detail like "success".
            #
            # From a data performance and complexity perspective,
            # I also think that having more metrics, each with
            # "normal" amount of describing attributes is better
            # distributing the data than having few generic
            # metrics with thousands of different describing
            # attributes and gazillions of data points per
            # metric. Though I'm not an expert here.

=head1 ABOUT

I<Level 2 receivers> are other data receivers besides Tapper to
which data is forwarded when a report is arriving at the
Tapper::Reports::Receiver.

One example is to track benchmark values.

By convention, for BenchmarkAnything the data is already prepared in
the TAP report like this:

 ok - measurements
   ---
   BenchmarkAnythingData:
   - NAME: example.prove.duration
     VALUE: 2.19
   - NAME: example.some.metric
     VALUE: 7.00
   - NAME: example.some.other.metric
     VALUE: 1
   ...
 ok some other TAP stuff

I.e., it requires a key C<BenchmarkAnythingData> and the contained
array consists of chunks with keys that a BenchmarkAnything backend
store is expecting.

=head1 CONFIG

To activate that level2 receiver you should have an entry like this in
your C<tapper.cfg>:

 receiver:
   level2:
     BenchmarkAnything:
       # actual benchmark entries
       benchmark_entries_path: //data/BenchmarkAnythingData/*
       # optional meta info to merge into each chunk of benchmark entries
       additional_metainfo_path: //data/PlatformDescription/*
       # whether that metainfo should also stored into the benchmark store
       store_metainfo_as_benchmarks: 0
       # whether test/TAP summary metrics should also stored into the benchmark store
       store_testmetrics_as_benchmarks: 0
       # whether to skip that plugin
       disabled: 0
